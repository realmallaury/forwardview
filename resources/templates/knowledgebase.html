        <h5><strong>What is Yūnō?</strong></h5>

        <p><em>有能 (Yūnō) - efficient (adjective), skill (noun).</em></p>

        <p>
          Throughout human history people were tracking prices of commodities. From 5000 years old Sumerian clay tablets to modern day
          machine learning trading algorithms, people were using various methods and technologies to track prices predict and predict
          their movement. But it was the practice of tracking prices through
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candlestick_chart" target="_blank"><strong>candlestick charts</strong></a>, invented
          by Japanese rice merchants of late 18th century that really popularized commodities trading. Around this practice,
          entire system of patters was built with aim of helping to predict the price movement.
        </p>

        <p>
          Just as these pioneers were aiming to understand the markets of their time, Yūnō is learning platform for developing expertise and
          intuition about reading markets for modern traders today. Its based on commonly used procedures
          of back testing and forward testing of price data for various asset classes with goals of developing deep intuition and trading knowledge.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today retail traders face many opportunities for trading various assets classes in markets all over the world, using tools that vary
          in complexity from simple mobile apps to full trading stations. However, many of these tools are designed to create compulsory
          behaviour within user, by providing casino-like-experience in trading. Also, many online trading and investing communities create
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink" target="_blank"><strong>groupthink</strong></a> frenzy effect where by various
          social media means specific assets are hyped as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, resulting in unaware user experiencing strong
          <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/panicbuying.asp" target="_blank"><strong>fear of missing out</strong></a> behaviour.
        </p>

        <p>
          The expected result of all this is that between various trading fees/commissions that thee tools charge and compulsory trading,
          any edge that user might have is eroded, in many cases resulting in
          <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/013015/worst-mistakes-beginner-traders-make.asp" target="_blank"><strong>wiping out</strong></a>
          entire trading account.
        </p>

        <p>
          Knowing all this, well informed modern retail trader has no choice but to develop its own
          <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trading-strategy.asp" target="_blank"><strong>trading system</strong></a> that's
          rigorously tested and adjusted to trader's personal goals, as well as his tolerance for risks involved with following his strategy.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>
            Our goal with Yūnō is to enable new retail traders in developing skills in reading market forces that shape the charts,
            familiarize them with various trading patterns and through repeated exposure to real market scenarios help traders
            become truly <a href="https://adamhgrimes.com/does-anyone-really-succeed-at-trading/" target="_blank"><strong>successful</strong></a>.

          Throughout Yūnō we will try to provide helpful tips and links to reinforce various trading concepts,

        <h5><strong>Developing yūnō</strong></h5>
      </div>

      <p>
        Within trading community there are two majors schools of thought: one is
        <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technical-analysis-of-stocks-and-trends.asp" target="_blank"><strong>technical analysis</strong></a> of
        a markets and another one is <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentalanalysis.asp" target="_blank"><strong>fundamental analysis</strong></a>.
        These two schools of thought differ in their approach to trading, practitioners of technical analysis
        make trading decisions based on information from past prices, while practitioners of fundamental analysis make their decisions
        based on underlying asset value and analyze company's financial data, macroeconomic factors, supply/demand etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        While Yūnō is a platform for forward testing of price data with primary goal to help trader develop chart stories insight into
        price changes, we also believe that there is also a lot of value in studying business fundamentals. To that end for each chart we also
        provide quick description and recent news of stock under consideration, as well as handy
        <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/ratioanalysis.asp" target="_blank"><strong>financial ratios</strong></a> that give more
        insight into a company's true value.
      </p>

      <p>
        We believe that this approach gives a trader greater chance to identify stock price imbalance with regards to it's true
        underlying value. By studying price charts and performing fundamental analysis, new trader can considerably grow his skills
        and get a sense of where this elusive
        <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/022415/vital-importance-defining-your-trading-edge.asp" target="_blank"><strong>trading edge</strong></a> lies.

        <h5><strong>Rules for the exercise</strong></h5>
      </div>
    <p>
      Forward looking exercises is a type of a
      <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/papertrade.asp" target="_blank"><strong>paper trading</strong></a>
      that can be performed on various asset classes, for this product we focus on stocks as this asset class provides a great entry point
      for new traders. Stocks are well researched topic with a lot of good community practices and evaluation metrics to follow.
    </p>

    <p>
      The procedure of trading for these types of exercise is simplified as opposed to what trader would encounter in full trading platform.
      The main idea here is to use near real time price data and various other market information but withhold last 20 or more working days.
      The trader can then evaluate the stock, price chart, related news and other fundamental and technical data and decide will he enter the
      trade.
    </p>

    <p>
      He can move forward day-by-day and try to find good entry point when he feels that current trading price offers good return on his
      investment. By performing this for various stocks, new trader begins to get a sense of various
      <a href="https://adamhgrimes.com/what-works/" target="_blank"><strong>market forces</strong></a> that influencing the
      price and start to make informed predictions on where the price could go.

      <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Walk forward in action</figcaption>
    </img>

    <p>
      The exercise also simplifies buying and selling process, assuming there are always willing buyers and sellers.
